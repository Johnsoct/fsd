> [!INFO] Mono

### Battery

Pulled from a well-researched [white paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2019/8235458):

| Property | Value |
|--|--|
| Timeout | 30 seconds |
| Timeframe | 5 minutes |
| Battery | 2000mAh / 3.7V |
| Energy cost | 600 joules / 5-minute |

The battery life would be **3.7 hours** performing a GET request every 5 minutes with a 30 second timeout.
