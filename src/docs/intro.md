# Frontend system design

<DocHeading />

There are three parts to most application designs:

1.	Backend
2.	API
3.	Frontend

The frontend system is comprised of four major design considerations, which we'll call **CFDC** (core frontend design considerations):

1.	API communication
2.	UI data management (state management)
3.	User interface interactions
4.	Asset management
